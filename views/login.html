    <p>Give-A-Shout uses federated identities.  This means you login to Give-A-Shout
    using your favorite sites account.</p>
    <p>There are many benefits to using federated identities.  Such as:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>You don't need to remember another user account!</li>
         <li>We don't have to worry about hackers stealing your password!  (We don't have it!)</li>
         <li>Less duplication of data!</li>
         <li>and many more!</li>
       </ul>
    <p>The process is simple you select the authentication provider from the list 
       above and login to their site using your credentials.  The provider
       provides Give-A-Shout with a token to let us know you are who you say you are.
       We trust that token and allow you to use our service.  After you login you
       will be routed to our profile page so you can provide us with a few basics.
       Then your done and able to post your first Shout!  Easy Peasy!</p>

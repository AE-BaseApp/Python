THE SOFTWARE IS NOT PRODUCTION READY!

The list below should not be considered Authoritative.  It is simply a list of
issues that the developers have noticed.  The software is Open Source so you
are free to modify the code.  Those modifications could result in issues that
compromise the software.  You should have a Qualified Engineer go over this
software as well as your changes before deployment.

As of Version 2 the following is a list of known issues:

  *  The software implicitly trusts User Input, there isn't any validation. This
     can lead to malicious content being stored and distributed.  Before using
     this software for public facing applications the user input should be
     validated and cleaned.
  *  The software uses GET/POST methods which have been shown to be weak to
     Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and code needs to be developed to
     prevent your application from being vulnerable.
  *  Cross Site Scripting (XSS) As above user input is not filtered thus a
     malicious user could add JavaScript to a Shout that is malicious.
  *  SQL Injection, this software uses the App Engine Datastore so most likely
     there is little chance of a SQL Injection attack, but it is possible with
     the current code a malicious user could inject code that creates the same 
     effect.
  *  Currently the software does not contain any error handling.  If something
     causes an error it will not be trapped and the software will crash.
  *  OpenID is only functioning on providers who have a login page.  Providers
     whom only authenticate via a URL are currently not supported.
  *  Time Zones seem a mish mosh, need to update at least the first results to
     disply the standard US Time Zones

This is only a list of known issues.  There could be other issues that have not
been discovered.

AE-BaseApp Goals:
-----------------
AE-BaseApp project and in this case AE-Python have three goals:
  1.  To create a Base Application that the community can use to start their
      projects with.
  2.  To provide a learning tool platform for entry level developers to work
      up to App Engine Engineers.
  3.  To provide similar apps on different platforms to give performance
      guidance, and a basic idea of how it affects costs.


AE-BaseApp Philosophy
---------------------
This project follows the KISS approach (for those not old enough or aware KISS
stands for Keep It Simple Silly actually should be Stupid but we're PC here).
In some cases there are more complicated ways to do something that are better
for certain use cases.  But the goals of this project are not to be an all 
encompassing base application, but provide the framework for your next super app,
as well as a learning tool for a platform that doesn't follow the conventions
you learned in CIS105.  You can feel free to change any part of the system to
meet your requirements.

Guiding Principles of the AE-BaseApp Project
    *  The KISS approach which as stated best by one of histories greatest minds
       Albert Einstein "everything should be made as simple as possible, but no
       simpler" or another great mind Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry's stated "It 
       seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, 
       but when there is nothing left to take away."
    *  RERO (in a Scoobie Doo voice) (means Release Early Release Often) Having
       read "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" it follow that this is the second
       most important principle.  Daily commits when the build isn't broke is
       preferred to huge once it is finished commits.  This allows the community
       to get a pulse on the project.  Find bugs before they are buried and 
       have better context to assist if you have a question.
    *  Ubuntu - Not the OS Distro but the principle.  We are all connected by 
       sharing this planet, through our humanity, even our culture and society.
       What we do affects the whole thus we need to show generosity for one
       another, give a helping hand to each other, and be happy that someone is
       capable.  Please read up on the principles if you are not familiar.
       There are many philosophies/religions that mirror the principles of
       Ubuntu, Buddhism, Christianity, Confusianism, no matter what it is called
       the meaning is the same.
    *  FOSS - The AE-BaseApp project is Free Open Source Software under the 
       Apache 2 License.  That means you are free to browse the source, change
       it, and share those changes.
